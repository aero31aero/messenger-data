I think GRRM is being cheeky by calling Jaime \"Kingslayer\" and have it taken as a pejorative term.   All along, GRRM is telling us that Jaime will slay the king. Jaime will successfully redefine that perception of \"Kingslayer\" as the noblest term as he will be savior of the realm.  That's that story that will be written in the book that details the exploits of the kings guard.  \n\nJaime has a Valerian steel sword so he has the means; he is heading north, so he has the opportunity.  The golden hand will somehow be used as an advantage, and he will die in the arms of Brienne.",

But to the surprise, Yummpys, diamond eatery (thickshakes), wich please had a bad environment and hygiene over there and those were asked by the administration to shut down immediately until further notice. We will update the actions taken on them as soon as possible.\n\nThe number of medical cases came down now as informed by the CMO. One of the reason might be the contamination of the foods that are to be frozen always and they are not on the days of long electricity shut downs.(This is the reason to take a check today to not to have the stock of the pre incident time). So, not to have these cases repeated, the process of providing power back up to every outlet is carrying on as said by the administration.\n\nEdit: Checking is done even in mess 1 , mess 2, chipotle, c3 and the refrigerated items of the pre incident from all these places are discarded.\n\nP.S: We will update you soon about the continuation of the normal services by both of the messes.\n\nP.P.S: If you think that there is a problem with hygiene take a step and dont take that food from that outlet.
